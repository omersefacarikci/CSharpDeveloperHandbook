<h1 align="center">C# Notes</h1>

<p align="center">
A structured and up-to-date collection of my C# programming notes.
This repository includes core concepts, code snippets, examples, and practical tips to support learning and development in C#. Ideal for both study and reference during projects.

This project contains 7 essential topics that document my learning process with the C# programming language. Each file focuses on a different subject. By working through each one, I have **completed** the foundational concepts of C#.

## 📁 File List and Descriptions

1. **Main.cs**  
   I learned how to print messages to the console using `Console.WriteLine` and receive user input with `Console.Read`. I have completed it.

2. **Variables.cs**  
   I learned how to declare and use variables such as `int`, `string`, `bool`, and `double`. I have completed it.

3. **Loops.cs**  
   I practiced the use of loops like `for`, `while`. I have completed it.

4. **Array.cs**  
   I learned how to declare arrays, access elements, and manipulate array data. I have completed it.

5. **Foreach.cs**  
   I understood how to use the `foreach` loop with arrays and collections. I have completed it.

6. **LoopsProject.cs**  
   I created mini-projects using loops and conditional structures to reinforce what I’ve learned. I have completed it.

7. **Database.cs**  
   I learned how to connect C# with an SQL Server database and perform basic operations like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. I have completed it.
