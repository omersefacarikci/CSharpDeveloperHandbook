<h1 align="center">C# Developer Handbook</h1>

<p align="center">
A structured and up-to-date collection of my C# programming notes.
This repository includes core concepts, code snippets, examples, and practical tips to support learning and development in C#. Ideal for both study and reference during projects.

This project contains 7 essential topics that document my learning process with the C# programming language. Each file focuses on a different subject. By working through each one, I have **completed** the foundational concepts of C#.

## üìÅ File List and Descriptions

 **Main.cs**  
   I learned how to print messages to the console using `Console.WriteLine` and receive user input with `Console.Read`. I have completed it.

 **Variables.cs**  
   I learned how to declare and use variables such as `int`, `string`, `bool`, and `double`. I have completed it.

 **Loops.cs**  
   I practiced the use of loops like `for`, `while`. I have completed it.

 **Array.cs**  
   I learned how to declare arrays, access elements, and manipulate array data. I have completed it.

 **Foreach.cs**  
   I understood how to use the `foreach` loop with arrays and collections. I have completed it.

 **LoopsProject.cs**  
   I created mini-projects using loops and conditional structures to reinforce what I‚Äôve learned. I have completed it.

 **Database.cs**  
   I learned how to connect C# with an SQL Server database and perform basic operations like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. I have completed it.

**Layer.cs**
Page Description: Tour Management System ‚Äì Statistics Panel
This page represents a statistics dashboard built with Entity Framework in a WinForms (Windows Forms) application. The purpose of this page is to display summarized, real-time data from the tourism system‚Äôs database such as locations, guides, tour capacities, and prices.
